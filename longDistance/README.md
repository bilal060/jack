# Long Distance Credential Capture Demo (Vercel)

This folder demonstrates how to capture credentials remotely using a public login form and a Vercel serverless function. You can use this to test remote session hijacking or phishing scenarios (for educational purposes only).

## üì¶ Files
- `api/capture.js` ‚Äî Vercel serverless function to capture and log credentials
- `public_login.html` ‚Äî Public login form that submits to the API

## üöÄ How to Deploy on Vercel

1. **Create a Vercel account:** https://vercel.com/
2. **Push this folder to a GitHub repo** (or your whole project)
3. **Import the repo into Vercel** and deploy
4. **After deployment, your API endpoint will be:**
   `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/api/capture`
5. **Your public login form will be at:**
   `https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/public_login.html`

## üß™ How to Test
1. Open the public login form URL in any browser (anywhere in the world)
2. Enter any email and password, then submit
3. The credentials will be sent to the Vercel function and logged in the Vercel dashboard (Functions > Logs)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal/Ethical Notice
- **Use only with explicit permission and for educational/testing purposes.**
- **Never use for real phishing or unauthorized data collection.**
- **Check your local laws and Vercel's terms of service.**

## üìù Example
- You (in Dubai) deploy the app to Vercel
- A test user (in Pakistan) visits your public login form and submits credentials
- You see the credentials in your Vercel function logs

# longDistance (Internal Test Project)

**For internal, ethical security testing only. Never deploy publicly.**

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open `stealth_test.html` from any device on the same local network:
   ```
   http://[office-server-ip]:3000/stealth_test.html
   ```
   (Replace `[office-server-ip]` with your server's local IP address)
4. The form will auto-submit and data will be logged in the server terminal.

## Safety
- Only use on your office/local network.
- Never expose to the public internet.
- Use only test accounts/devices.
- Remove all test code after use.
- Document your testing for compliance.
